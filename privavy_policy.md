•	If you create an account with us, our App may provide you with a functionality that allows you to store additional information that you may later elect to provide to a property in connection with making a rental application, such as self-reported employment, income and credit score information.  If you store such information, you may delete it at any time, and you control whether you share it with any properties and/or landlords.  
•	If you use some of the Services offered through the App, your information may be collected and processed by third parties.

o	Similarly, our App may facilitate your ability to file an application with a landlord to evaluate your eligibility for a particular property.  This functionality may facilitate the collection of your credit score information, self-reported income, and background checks.  We use technology that passes the information necessary to obtain a credit score and background check directly to third parties who process such requests.
